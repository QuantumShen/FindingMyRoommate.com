## The Idea
I found my roommates and a good apartment very near to my university recently by looking for information in a `qq` chatting group called "Looking for apartments and roommates".

About 800 Chinese students are in that chat room exchanging information about apartments, roommates, subleases and ride-sharing. But obviously a chat room is not an ideal place to publish these information. It is difficult to collect useful information because texts sink quickly during chatting. Further more, it is not possible to judge whether a piece of old information is still valid when you find it. Inspired by my experience using this chat room I decided to make a web application to provide services such as posting and looking for these information.

## Three main services
1. Start or join a ride share
2. Start or join a roommates group to rent apartments together
3. Provide or require sublease

## The stack
I am using meteor to make the app since it is fast.
